# give-backathon

This was a project made for the Give Backathon Hackathon, the clients problem's were the following:
- Need a form of map visualisation to make strategic decisions in the future
- Need a way to show the work they done 

Our solution was to use CarterJS and MapBox, to create a map visualisation and address both problems. 

Our client at the time was the Street movement.
