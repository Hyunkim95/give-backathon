        <h3>Community Centre</h3>
        <p>This is the heartbeat of the Street’s Movement Organisation.  The epicentre of the the positive influence of the community. From here we have been able to reach 13000 people through a range of programs which include boxing, youth work, women fitness classes and more! We have also had programs that involve food banks and creation of music through a music studio which allows a space for people to work on their projects and allowed them to build confidence. Further, often mentors help the community too, including a recent program where volunteers from JCU were helping with mentoring programs for more than a year.</p>

The programs are aimed at youth but open to all ages as it helps build resillience and self- desicipline. They also organise community sporting events which gives an opportunity to those participating a chance to build team-work and controlled discipline.</p>
